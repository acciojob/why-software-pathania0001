		Why I want to become a developer?
		</span>
	</h1>

		<p>
		I've always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems and improve lives. Becoming a software developer allows me to turn ideas into reality through code. I'm excited by the constant learning and creativity involved in development, and I love the idea of building tools that can help others. The ability to collaborate, innovate, and grow in this field deeply motivates me to pursue a career in software development.
